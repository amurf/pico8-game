# Todo

* Move all of the flags set on sprites, to functions, like this: function solid mget(tilex, tiley, 0) end so its self-documenting each type
* Add debug utility which just sends output to printh($out, $file, true)
* Create some functions for dealing with collision detection, this needs to iterate in the global update over the arrays of objects and compare them. See https://level0gamedev.blogspot.com.au/2016/05/collisions-for-randomized-enemies-also.html
